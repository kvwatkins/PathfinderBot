When you prepare your spells, you can fill a combination slot with a combination of two spells. Each spell in the combination must be 2 or more spell levels below the slot's level, and both must target only one creature or object or have the option to target only one creature or object. Each spell in the combination must also have the same means of determining whether it has an effect-both spells must require a ranged spell attack roll, require the same type of saving throw, or automatically affect the target.</p>\n<p>When you cast a combined spell, it affects only one target, even if the component spells normally affect more than one. If any spell in the combination has further restrictions (such as targeting only living creatures), you must abide by all restrictions. The combined spell uses the shorter of the component spells' ranges. Resolve a combined spell as if were a single spell, but apply the effects of both component spells. For example, if the spell's target succeeded at the save against a combined spell, it would apply the success effect of each spell, and if it critically failed, it would apply the critical failure effect of both spells.</p>"},"featType":{"value":"class"},"level":{"value":20},"prerequisites":{"value":[]},"rules":[],"source":{"value":"Pathfinder Core Rulebook"},"traits":{"custom":"","rarity":{"value":"common"},"value":["wizard"]}},"effects":[],"name":"Spell Combination","type":"feat"},{"_id":"pedHIDAVLFzzjGO1","data":{"actionCategory":{"value":""},"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"description":{"value":"<p>You don't just resist magic; you devour it.

Manual control is required only in the heat of combat, not for less strenuous adventuring or everyday activities.</p>\n<p>You need to keep your sterling dynamo wound, but the process isn't particularly onerous, so in most situations, it won't be an issue. If you spend 1 minute winding up your dynamo, it can remain active for 24 hours before needing additional winding. However, enemies can attempt to Disable the dynamo, which has a level equal to your own, to reduce the remaining operational time by 1 hour, or 2 hours on a critical success. Certain other abilities that adversely affect technology might also reduce the dynamo's remaining operational time. When your dynamo is out of operational time, you can still use it as a normal prosthetic, but you cannot use your dynamo unarmed attack or any other abilities from this archetype until you wind the dynamo again. You can wind the dynamo for 1 minute at any time to return it to the maximum 24 hours of operational time.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the sterling dynamo archetype.</p>"},"featType":{"value":"archetype"},"level":{"value":2},"location":"","prerequisites":{"value":[]},"rules":[],"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"custom":"","rarity":{"value":"uncommon"},"value":["archetype","dedication"]}},"effects":[],"name":"Sterling Dynamo Dedication","type":"feat"},{"_id":"zXKfKKOxht0b0XNL","data":{"actionCategory":{"value":""},"actionType":{"value":"free"},"actions":{"value":null},"description":{"value":"<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per round</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> You use @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.Quick Alchemy]{Quick Alchemy} to craft an alchemical bomb, and that bomb's level is at least 2 levels lower than your advanced alchemy level</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You mix in an additive to make your bomb's contents adhere to the target and continue to deal damage.</p>\n<p>A creature that takes a direct hit from one of your sticky bombs also takes persistent damage equal to and of the same type as the bomb's splash damage.

Your social identity is an upstanding member of society, while your vigilante identity is a skilled and cunning warrior. Neither of these identities is a false front; you really are both of these people, and as such, your two identities can be at most one alignment step from each other (for instance, you could be neutral in one identity and neutral evil in the other, but not chaotic evil in the other).</p>\n<p>If someone attempts to discern your other identity, they must use a @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Seek]{Seek} action to attempt a Perception check against your Deception DC, as if you were using the @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Impersonate]{Impersonate} action. Your Deception DC against such attempts is 20 + your proficiency modifier instead of the normal DC.

You can use social feats only while in your social identity. Your class feats and vigilante feats are associated with your vigilante identity, and using them while in your social identity risks exposing you as a vigilante. This means that if you were particularly meek or inconspicuous before you took this feat, your identity could be at greater risk of exposure. If your identity is exposed to the public, you lose the benefits of Vigilante Dedication to disguising yourself, but you can otherwise use both social and vigilante abilities in either identity unless they rely on your identity being a secret.
