Abadar's cathedral-banks are found in many cities and places where order thrives or is gaining a foothold. Aristocrats, city guards, merchants, and those working in legal practice or who have the well-being of their community on their mind are common worshippers of the god of cities, along with dwarves in general. Abadaran priests living in cities often serve as judges, lawyers, and clerks, while those who live on the frontier work as roving magistrates, acting as judge, jury, and executioners in the name of order.</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> bring civilization to the frontiers, earn wealth through hard work and trade, follow the rule of law</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> engage in banditry or piracy, steal, undermine a law-abiding court</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> cities, law, merchants, and wealth</p>\n<p><strong>Follower Alignments</strong> LG, LN, LE</span></p>\n<p></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Devotee Benefits</h2>\n<div>\n<div><strong>Divine Ability</strong> Constitution or Intelligence</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Font</strong> harm or heal</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Skill</strong> Society</div>\n<div><strong>Favored</strong> <strong>Weapon</strong> @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.Crossbow]{Crossbow}</div>\n<div><strong>Domains</strong> cities, earth, travel, wealth</div>\n<div><strong>Alternate Domains</strong> duty</div>\n<div><strong>Cleric Spells</strong> 1st: <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Illusory Object]{Illusory Object}</em>, 4th: <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Creation]{Creation}</em>, 7th: <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Magnificent Mansion]{Magnificent Mansion}</em></div>\n</div>\n<h2>Divine Intercession</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">Abadar's gifts take the form of riches, while his ire tends to cause offenders to lose wealth.</p>\n<p><strong>Minor Boon</strong>: Abadar warns his favored against those who might unfairly take advantage. Once, when someone rolls a success on a Deception check to Lie maliciously to you and you alone, they get a critical failure instead. Abadar typically chooses to grant this boon in response to an extremely consequential lie.</p>\n<p><strong>Moderate Boon</strong>: Abadar blesses all your enterprises, leading to financial success as all your ventures always seems to work out. If you roll a critical failure at a check to Earn Income, you get a failure instead. If you roll a success on a check to Earn Income, you earn twice the usual amount of income.</p>\n<p><strong>Major Boon</strong>: Your silver tongue is infallible, allowing you to reach a compromise if one is even remotely possible. Once per day, you know just what to offer to make a deal or broker a negotiation, and if you offer your divinely inspired deal, you can automatically receive a result of 20 + your Diplomacy modifier on your Diplomacy check instead of rolling. This does not increase your degree of success like rolling a 20 would. If there is legitimately nothing you could offer to reach an agreement, you learn that, and you don't expend your daily use of the boon.</p>\n<p><strong>Minor Curse</strong>: Any time you steal, illegally harm or kill another creature, or undermine a law-abiding officer or court, a symbol or word describing your crime appears on a visible spot on your skin. This symbol cannot be removed or hidden with makeup (though it can be covered with clothing) and it doesn't vanish until you make legal restitution for the crime, such as by serving your sentence.</p>\n<p><strong>Moderate Curse</strong>: Abadar curses all your enterprises, leading to financial disaster as all your ventures always seem to fail. The result of your check to Earn Income is always one degree of success worse than the one you rolled.</p>\n<p><strong>Major Curse</strong>: You become honest to a fault. You constantly suffer the critical failure effect of zone of truth.

Known as He Who Walks in Blood, he slumbers in the blood of heretics and worshippers alike in an immense cleft carved into the base of the Boneyard's spire, a realm known as the Blood Vale.

Your name and location are mentally projected into the mind of a Red Mantis assassin, who is tasked with eliminating you.</p><p><strong>Major Curse</strong>: The Mantis God doesn't waste his time toying with or tormenting those who truly anger him, or those who dare to consider themselves divine.

While the goddess Adanye is not considered to be their creator, she is said to have mentored these first guardians, teaching them the skills necessary to protect and defend, both in combat and in careful interaction with others. She also taught the importance of what they protected, identifying the hearth and the home, as well as the right to self-determination and to solitude, as worthy of defense. She is said to have instilled in the amurruns their need for solitude and their esteem of imagination. A master teacher, she is depicted as a graying catfolk woman or a cat by the hearth fire, her large, gentle eyes full of wisdom.</p>\n<p>The tenets of Adanye's faith are few and flexible. She helps the curious and the wandering to retain their sense of self and their need to stay safe as they discover and grow. She honors the hours spent daydreaming on the hearth, whether that hearth is next to the fire pit at a remote campsite or in the kitchen of a generations-old homestead. She does not proscribe much. She adds to the serendipitous outlook of the catfolk, enhancing their inborn curiosity. Her worship tends to temper willfulness and wanderlust, reminding her followers of the safety and security to be found in having a spot of their own, even if that spot is temporary. She understands that sometimes the best protection is a retreat and gently reminds her followers of the virtue of impermanence and of existing in the moment. Rather than looking into the past or the future, she enjoins fully inhabiting the present-the place where one is, the hearth by which one naps, the company that one currently keeps, especially when it can be done in solitude.</p>\n<p>Because the catfolk of Southern Garund have not established large communities outside of Murraseth, there are no temples to Adanye outside of their homeland, only small shrines erected by travelers, perhaps near seldom-used mountain trails or in the corners of large temples dedicated to other gods. Her worshippers often paint or sketch her holy symbol, a simple paw print in orange (or on an orange background), which is sometimes enhanced with sketched flames or another symbol of fire, in an inconspicuous cornerstone of a building or on a fallen log. Adanye has an affinity with Desna and with Shelyn, given their overlapping interests in dreamers and individualism. Although she has a longstanding rivalry with the Osirian feline goddess Bastet, she does not spend much time feuding. Adanye's care is wholly enjoined upon her followers.</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> keep your counsel, follow your heart, appreciate a warm hearth, defend those who welcome you into their home</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> force anyone into drudgery or mindless work, deny support to loved ones, surrender when escape is an option, destroy a place that has given you shelter</p>\n<p><strong>Follower Alignments</strong> LG, LN, NG, CG</p>\n<h2>Devotee Benefits</h2>\n<div><strong>Divine Font</strong> heal</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Ability</strong> Dexterity or Wisdom</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Skill</strong> Society</div>\n<div><strong>Favored Weapon</strong> claws or @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.Kukri]{Kukri}</div>\n<div><strong>Domains</strong> duty, family, protection, repose</div>\n<div><strong>Alternate Domains</strong> confidence, fire</div>\n<div><strong>Cleric Spells</strong> 1st: <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Feather Fall]{Feather Fall}</em>, 2nd:<em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Misdirection]{Misdirection}</em>, 7th: <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Magnificent Mansion]{Magnificent Mansion}</em></div>\n<h2>Avatar</h2>\n<p>When casting the <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Avatar]{Avatar}</em> spell, a worshipper of Adanye gains the following additional abilities.</p>\n<p><strong>Adanye</strong> Speed 70 feet, climb speed 70 feet, immune to @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Immobilized]{Immobilized};</p>\n<p>Melee <span class=\"pf2-icon\">1</span> claw (agile, finesse, reach 15 feet), Damage [[/r {6d10+6}[slashing]]]{6d10+6 slashing damage};</p>\n<p>Ranged <span class=\"pf2-icon\">1</span> hearth ember (range 120 feet), Damage [[/r {4d6+3}[fire]]]{4d6+3 fire damage} and [[/r {2d6}[persistent,fire]]] @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Persistent Damage]{Persistent Fire Damage}</p>","name":"Adanye"},{"_id":"pCtJONJlhAugUXaG","content":"<h1>Ahriman (Lord of the Divs) [NE]</h1><p>The dread shadow known as Ahriman counts servants mainly among div as well as a scattering of followers throughout the mortal realm. </p><p></p><p><strong>Edicts</strong> Foil rulers, the proud, and the powerful; ruin anything created by mortals</p><p><strong>Anathema</strong> create arts or crafts, serve a mortal, assist in mortal aims except to subvert and corrupt them</p><p><strong>Follower Alignments</strong> LE, NE, CE</span></p><h2>Devotee Benefits</h2><p><strong>Divine Font</strong> <em>harm</em></p><p><strong>Divine Skill </strong>Deception</p><p><strong>Favored Weapon</strong> whip<u></u></p><p><strong>Domains</strong> darkness, death, destruction, trickery</p><p><strong>Cleric Spells</strong> 1st: <em>ill omen</em>, 3rd: <em>nondetection</em>, 5th: <em>chrushing despair</em></p>","name":"Ahriman"},{"_id":"uXkMGx0OD896ZQlT","content":"<h1>Alglenweis (Princess of the Rime) [CG]</h1><p><strong>Alglenweis</strong> is the daughter of Kostchtchie and one of the major deities formerly worshipped in Sarkoris.

Occasionally, those slain in combat by Angazhan's minions are reincarnated forcefully into an ape-like creature in the service of the Ravenous King.

Few dragons practice divine magic, preferring to leave that to their humanoid allies. As Apsu's prime purpose is the destruction of Dahak, few non-dragons take up his cause, although honourable humanoids with an interest in draconic lore have taken up his faith from time to time.

The Legion's leaders prohibit their priests from revealing Apsu's connection to Golarion, so younger legionnaires would not be tempted to prematurely journey there to help him. Instead, they hope to raise a grand army to offer Apsu when the time comes for him to fight Dahak.</p><p></p><p><strong>Edicts</strong> Seek and destroy evil, travel the world, help others fend for themselves</p><p><strong>Anathema</strong> Fail to pursue a foe who has betrayed your mercy, attack a creature without certainty of wrongdoing</p><p><strong>Follower Alignments</strong> LG, NG, CG</span></p><p></span></p><h2>Devotee Benefits</h2><div><div><strong>Divine Ability</strong> Wisdom or Charisma</div><div><strong>Divine Font</strong> heal</div><div><strong>Divine Skill</strong> Diplomacy</div><div><strong>Favored Weapon</strong> jaws or staff</div><div><strong>Domains</strong> creation, protection, travel, wyrmkin</div><div><strong>Cleric Spells</strong> 1st: magic fang, 4th: creation, 6th: dragon form (metallic dragons only)</div></div><p> </p>","name":"Apsu"},{"_id":"HtRxo4J3elFteIqu","content":"<h1 class=\"title\">Arazni (The Unyielding) [NE]</h1>\n<p class=\"title\"><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\"><img class=\"thumbnail\" style=\"float: right;\" src=\"https://2e.aonprd.com/Images/Deities/Arazni.png\" width=\"119\" height=\"120\" /><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">More than anything, Arazni is a survivor.

While many people consider this to be more of a vice than a virtue, Chaldira and her followers feel it is far better to run headlong into trouble than it is to meekly concede to evil out of fear or convenience. Chaldira is also the goddess of light-hearted mischief, insisting that harmless fun, even at others' expense, brings joy and strengthens ties within a community. While not all of Chaldira's followers are inveterate pranksters, most at least know some sleight-of-hand tricks.

The immortal tyrant punishes anyone who lacks faith with death, and there is no worse blasphemy than to worship a rival god in his city. But the freedom fighter Sihar and her followers, the Bright Lions, have spread the word of the old sun gods in secret, and now they are returning to the people.</p>\n<p>Even though it has only been just over a century since Walkena retook the throne, worship of the Old Sun Gods waned before then. Their teachings had been ingrained into day to day life, and many Mzali traditions can be traced directly to rituals started by sun kings-rulers believed to be descended from the old sun gods. But when the Council of Mwanyisa overthrew the sun kings and led Mzali's empire into decline, the people grew complacent in their worship, and in turn, so did the sun gods grow complacent themselves.</p>\n<p>After the child-god's rise, Walkena's priests scoured the city of any other deities, smashing statues and temples, editing the truth to Walkena's liking and destroying the rest. In doing so, the names Tlehar, Chohar and Luhar were mostly erased from public memory, with the remnants subverted to Walkena's needs. It was only in the deepest hidden chambers that any sign of their original teachings still existed. Now that they have been rediscovered, Chohar has no intention of being forgotten again.</p>\n<p>While Walkena and Chohar both call themselves gods of justice, the Old Sun God abhors Walkena's cruel and merciless sense of the concept. Chohar teaches that it is one's duty to fight for the innocent and powerless, and to never wield power for one's own benefit. The sun god has much grander goals than dealing with what he sees as a mere pretender god, however. Merely defeating the tyrant that rules them would not be enough to undo the generations of misfortune. The people must find a renewed sense of strength and pride, so that they can fight for themselves. Until then, Chohar will shine down on them, offering any protection he can. When the time comes, he will lead his people into a bright future.</p>\n<p>While the Old Sun Gods are considered equal in importance, Chohar attracts the largest following of worshippers, both historically and today. Still, even those who prefer the teachings of a particular sun god typically pay respect and homage to the other two as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> finish any and all tasks you accept, bring those who are cruel to justice, show pride in your home and your heritage</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> break your word, be cruel to the innocent, rebuke someone due to their homeland</p>\n<p><strong>Follower Alignments</strong> LG, LN, NG</p>\n<h2>Devotee Benefits</h2>\n<div><strong>Divine Font</strong> heal</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Ability</strong> Strength or Charisma</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Skill</strong> Intimidation</div>\n<div><strong>Favored Weapon</strong> @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.Starknife]{Starknife}</div>\n<div><strong>Domains</strong> fire, family, cities, sun</div>\n<div><strong>Alternate Domains</strong> duty, toil, vigil, zeal</div>\n<div><strong>Cleric Spells</strong> 1st: <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Burning Hands]{Burning Hands}</em>, 3rd:<em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Fireball]{Fireball}</em>, 4th: <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Fire Shield]{Fire Shield}</em></div>\n<h2>Avatar</h2>\n<p>When casting the <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Avatar]{Avatar}</em> spell, a worshipper of Chohar gains the following additional abilities.</p>\n<p><strong>Chohar </strong>Speed 70 feet, <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Air Walk]{Air Walk (Constant)}</em>;</p>\n<p>Melee <span class=\"pf2-icon\">1</span> jaws (agile, reach 15 feet), Damage [[/r {5d6+6}[piercing]]]{5d6+6 piercing damage} plus [[/r {1d6}[fire]]]{1d6 fire damage};</p>\n<p>Ranged <span class=\"pf2-icon\">1</span> sunbeam (range 120 feet), Damage [[/r {6d6+6}[fire]]]{6d6+6 fire damage}</p>","name":"Chohar"},{"_id":"oV5cnlPJQS8JfMIg","content":"<h1>Cosmic Caravan [CG]</h1><p>The Cosmic Caravan is known to astronomers and astrologers alike as a collection of constellations in the sky, said to travel forever in a circle around the star Cynosure.

The order was founded in 3988 AR when the gentleman-explorer Aldus Canter returned from the Osirian desert where he had been lost for 3 years. Aldus spoke of meeting a cult following a desiccated angel named Tabris. Tabris revealed the secret history of the multiverse and tasked Aldus with acting as a messenger of mystic secrets. Upon his return, Aldus gathered a coterie of his fellow Ustalavic nobles eager to plumb these secrets. His message was far from clear, however, consisting of garbled and coded texts in an untidy medley of Osirian mysticism, Pharasmin rites, and Varisian occult lore. Scouring Aldus's texts-both those brought from Osirion and his many annotations and reinterpretations penned thereafter-has been the order's primary activity for centuries, even before the increasingly erratic Aldus disappeared in 4028 AR. The Esoteric Order's meticulous research has produced occult secrets and mystical rites known nowhere else on Golarion and hints at further secret lore for the enlightened.

As stewards of their peoples' oral traditions, they act as historians, educators, and entertainers, so it is only right that they pay homage to the goddess of stories, Grandmother Spider. Also known as Nana Anadi, Grandmother Spider was once content in her role as weaver of fate for the gods, as it gave her the ability to craft the grandest tales anyone had ever known. But as she told story after story at the other gods' whims, they failed to show proper respect to the one who made their glorious and terrible legends come to pass, treating her as a servant or a tool. Grandmother had no patience for overinflated egos, and even less for those who take credit for the work of others. She crafted unique humiliations tailored to each of the gods, and as tales of her mischief spread, she wove her own divinity from them. Some of the more prideful gods deny her still-worshiping Grandmother Spider is forbidden by Asmodeus for as long as she still twirls copies of his keys around her fingers, and Abadar still holds a grudge since the Century of the Unbalanced Scale. To the north of the Mwangi, there are almost no shrines dedicated to Grandmother Spider. But the clever and willful always find ways to revere her.</p>\n<p>No matter how their pride might be wounded, few have dared to take direct action against Grandmother Spider. Alone, she is dangerous enough, for they say Nana Anadi holds all the secrets of the world within her web. However, her sibling Achaekek, the Red Mantis, is a force that even gods fear. Though he treats his sister with indifference, he once lashed out at someone who sought to do Grandmother Spider harm with disproportionate retribution. That one act has been more than enough.</p>\n<p>Grandmother Spider uplifts those who rebel against the status quo, strike above their station, or otherwise fight for freedom. While she prefers subterfuge and cleverness, she does not eschew violence, viewing it as simply another tool-applied judiciously in the right place at the right time, it can accomplish a great deal. Abolitionists and freedom fighters across Mwangi view spiders as an omen of good fortune. Those who are forced to live and fight in secret against their oppressors take great comfort in the knowledge that Nana Anadi will still tell their stories long after they are gone.</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> be skilled and clever, think for yourself, take due payment for your work, humiliate the powerful</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> abuse someone you have power over, harm someone who has given you sincere kindness, let a slight go unanswered, own a slave</p>\n<p><strong>Follower Alignments</strong> NG, N, CG, CN</p>\n<h2>Devotee Benefits</h2>\n<div><strong>Divine Font</strong> harm or heal</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Ability</strong> Intelligence or Wisdom</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Skill</strong> Crafting</div>\n<div><strong>Favored Weapon</strong> @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.Bola]{Bola}</div>\n<div><strong>Domains</strong> creation, fate, family, trickery</div>\n<div><strong>Alternate Domains</strong> change, darkness</div>\n<div><strong>Cleric Spells</strong> 1st: <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Pest Form]{Pest Form}</em>, 2nd:<em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Web]{Web}</em>, 4th: <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Glibness]{Glibness}</em></div>\n<h2>Avatar</h2>\n<p>When casting the <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Avatar]{Avatar}</em> spell, a worshipper of Grandmother Spider gains the following additional abilities.</p>\n<p><strong>Grandmother Spider </strong>Speed 70 feet, Climb speed 70 feet, Immune to @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Immobilized]{Immobilized};</p>\n<p>1 leg (deadly 3d8, finesse, reach 15 feet, versatile P), Damage [[/r {6d6+6}[bludgeoning]]]{6d6+6 bludgeoning damage};</p>\n<p>1 venom web (range 120 feet), Damage [[/r {6d6+3}[poison]]]{6d6+3 poison damage}</p>","name":"Grandmother Spider"},{"_id":"KT7HKL7vbZEwbzX4","content":"<h1>Green Faith</span></h1><p>While the Green Faith is practiced differently from one believer to another, especially across its various orders, its adherents share a universal reverence for the natural world and a commitment to preserving it.

Many Koradans seek greater wisdom through study or meditation in hopes of better understanding their foes so as to guide them toward redemption. This dedication to self-awareness, philosophy, and introspection is said to have allowed Korada greater insight into the workings of the universe, granting him the great gift of foresight.

The slaughter of fellow mortals for the glory of distant, unfathomable beings is not something that should be permitted within a society.

Now he not only rejects her gift, but instills so much fear in his followers that their rest is fitful and brief.</p>\n<p>The goddess of dusk is most often portrayed as a lioness with the head of a woman, with skin as dark as night and eyes that shine like stars. She is typically depicted at Chohar's right hand, often asleep while the midday lion stands vigil. Some of her worshippers follow her example, taking long naps during the day so that they can be better prepared to keep watch over sleeping companions at night. Luhar's followers believe there is no greater calling than to face the dangers of the night for the sake of those one wants to protect.</p>\n<p>There are many gods of dreams, but to Luhar, it is sleep itself that is most precious. Death is simply the final, and most precious, sleep. While still a somber experience, it is not one that followers seek to delay. When death comes, they only pray that it will be painless and swift. Luhar answers these prayers and crafts each death personally, doing everything in her power to make one's final moments peaceful. As such, she has a great disdain for grave robbers, necromancers, and any who would defile her gifts. In the past, priestesses of Luhar would bury the dead with obsidian lion tokens. While the tokens may have been simple trinkets, some believed that if their faith was strong, the black lion would manifest with them in the afterlife and protect their soul until their next life.</p>\n<p>In truth, it is not Walkena who Luhar finds most upsetting. It is the people who removed Walkena from his final rest and put his body on display for their own benefit who could not be more abhorrent to the goddess. To turn death into a spectacle for profit went against all of her teachings. When their time came, Luhar did not answer their prayers. Their ends were not peaceful. They were not brief.

Few recall the Empress of the Torrent's name, but cults dedicated to an enigmatic figure called the Queen of the Depths have begun to arise, heralding an event they refer to as the Awakening, and some planar scholars believe these cultists seek to free Lysianassa from her prison.</p><p><strong>Edicts</strong> Respect and aid natural cycles, promote life and growth, change to avoid stagnation, swim</p><p><strong>Anathema</strong> Pollute clean bodies of water, dam a river, disrespect sincere gifts of water or drink</p><p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> currents, tides, and water</p><p><strong>Follower Alignments</strong> LG, NG, CG, N</span></p><p></span></p><h2>Devotee Benefits</h2><div><div><strong>Divine Ability</strong> Dexterity or Constitution</div><div><strong>Divine Font</strong> heal</div><div><strong>Divine Skill</strong> Survival</div><div><strong>Favored Weapon</strong> spear</div><div><strong>Domains</strong> change, fate, nature, water</div><div><strong>Cleric Spells</strong> 1st: hydraulic push, 3rd: abyssal plague (aqueous orb (Advanced Player's Guide, coming soon)), 5th: control water</div></div>","name":"Lysianassa"},{"_id":"ArmPZQrl0SFAKvrY","content":"<h1>Ma'at (The Feather of Truth) [LN]</h1><p><strong>Edicts</strong> Defend civilization from chaos, live an honest and just life, be impartial in judgment and reveal the truth</p><p><strong>Anathema</strong> Deal unfairly with your family or community, destroy the environment, lie</p><p><strong>Follower Alignments</strong> LG, LN, N</span></p><p></span></p><h2>Devotee Benefits</h2><div><div><strong>Divine Ability</strong> Intelligence or Wisdom</div><div><strong>Divine Font</strong> heal</div><div><strong>Divine Skill</strong> Society</div><div><strong>Favored Weapon</strong> starknife</div><div><strong>Domains</strong> knowledge, protection, star, truth</div><div><strong>Cleric Spells</strong> 1st: feather fall, 4th: resilient sphere, 5th: mind probe</div></div>","name":"Ma'at"},{"_id":"iMRXc519Uepf8yH3","content":"<h1>Magdh (The Three) [LN]</h1><p>Magdh is the Eldest of foreknowledge, complexity, and triplets, and she is the greatest seer in the First World.

However, her actions during Earthfall and the Age of Darkness saved untold lives in Mwangi. Dismayed by the chaos and loss of life, Mazludeh spurred her fellow empyreal lords into action, forming a divine concordance that protected the Garundi nation of Holomog from devastation. Mazludeh's efforts elevated her to true divinity and the status of the matron goddess of the nation of Holomog. Now the goddess of negotiations and treaties, her followers often travel with merchants and ambassadors. She is also considered the diplomat to the other empyreal lords, able to pass on prayers to those most suited to answer them and persuade celestial beings to see to their fulfillment. Throughout the Mwangi, worshippers of Mazludeh have developed a reputation for being brave, empathetic, and fair even to their enemies.</p>\n<p>Over the years, it has become increasingly common for Mwangi communities to pay homage to Mazludeh, especially when constructing new homes and settlements, although more structured worship is still rare. Mazludeh sees the love and care in all Mwangi communities and offers them all the protections she can. Even before her presence there, many edicts of her faith were already common practice, expected of any contributing member of society. New worshippers of Mazludeh were thus required to make very little change to the way they already lived their lives.</p>\n<p>Mazludeh is often depicted either as a giant serpent with a mane of eggs and fresh figs, or as a woman with serpents for hair. It is heavily debated among scholars what this dual nature could mean, but most agree that her divinity likely predates humans, and that they adopted her later on. Unlike her worship in other parts of the world, worshippers in Mwangi tend to embrace Mazludeh's duality. To deny either side of her would be to deny a part of her, and both are necessary to fully understand the deity. To them, she represents not only unity with one's neighbors, but unity and coexistence with nature. Living in balance with the food one grows, the animals one hunts, and the land one lives on is just as important anything that happens within the walls of a home.</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> seek to improve yourself and your community, trust those you work with, encourage cooperation</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> betray another's trust, place conflict between ideological differences over people's lives</p>\n<p><strong>Follower Alignments</strong> LG, NG, CG</p>\n<h2>Devotee Benefits</h2>\n<div><strong>Divine Font</strong> heal</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Ability</strong> Wisdom or Charisma</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Skill</strong> Diplomacy</div>\n<div><strong>Favored Weapon</strong> @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.Shield Boss]{Shield Boss}</div>\n<div><strong>Domains</strong> cities, family, knowledge, perfection</div>\n<div><strong>Alternate Domains</strong> duty, nature</div>\n<div><strong>Cleric Spells</strong> 1st: <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Share Lore]{Share Lore}</em>, 4th:<em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Shape Stone]{Shape Stone}</em>, 5th: <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Wall of Stone]{Wall of Stone}</em></div>\n<h2>Avatar</h2>\n<p>When casting the <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Avatar]{Avatar}</em> spell, a worshipper of Mazludeh gains the following additional abilities.</p>\n<p><strong>Mazludeh</strong> Speed 70 feet, climb speed 50 feet, shield (hardness 15, can't be damaged);</p>\n<p>Melee <span class=\"pf2-icon\">1</span> viper strike (reach 15 feet), Damage [[/r {6d10+6}[piercing]]]{6d10+6 piercing damage};</p>\n<p>Ranged <span class=\"pf2-icon\">1</span> stone rain (range 120 feet), Damage [[/r {6d6+3}[bludgeoning]]]{6d6+3 bludgeoning damage}</p>","name":"Mazludeh"},{"_id":"KWVdoAm3b01M8Lcp","content":"<h1>Mephistopheles (The Crimson Son) [LE]</h1><p>The archdevil Mephistopheles was shaped of the ashes and fire of Hell itself to convey the plane's will.

She was once a mortal gnome who loved the thrill of an exciting wager, up to and including the moment when the dice turned against her. Eventually, Nivi's debts grew too great for her to remain in her surface home, and she fled into the depths of the Darklands to evade the wrath of her creditors.

Once, instead of attempting the check you would normally roll, you attempt a DC 11 flat check with the same results. Nivi always grants this boon when the odds are stacked against you (though this same effect is an alternate to her minor curse if she uses it for a check when you would have been very likely to succeed).</p><p><strong>Moderate Boon</strong>: Nivi bestows a fraction of her skill at pushing consequences down the road. Once per day, after attempting a check, you can roll a second time. You must use the result of the second roll, even if it is worse. This is a fortune effect. At any point after you use this boon, the GM can replace one of your check results with the first result of the check you attempted when using this boon; this delayed result can't be further delayed, prevented, or affected in any way, even by other divine intercessions.</p><p><strong>Major Boon</strong>: Those who have done much to please Nivi find themselves slipping from sight when needed. Any time you attempt a Stealth check to Hide or Sneak, you also gain the effects of 2nd-level invisibility and fleet step spells to help you elude your enemies. These effects last until the end of your next turn or until you stop Hiding or Sneaking, whichever comes first (you can continue to Hide or Sneak, turn after turn, to extend these effects).</p><p><strong>Minor Curse</strong>: Those who betray Nivi's trust find defeat where there was sure to be victory.

Traditionally, each Shoanti undergoes a rite of passage into adulthood, during which time their particular totem manifests, and a Shoanti's first tattoo is an homage to that totem. The quahs and their most common totems are listed below:</p><p><strong>Lyrune-Quah (Moon Clan)</strong> bat, cave bear, moon, mountain lion, owl, stars</p><p><strong>Shadde-Quah (Axe Clan)</strong> cliffs, eagle, sea, shark, squid, water elemental</p><p><strong>Shriikirri-Quah (Hawk Clan)</strong> cloud, falcon, hawk, hippogriff, horse, wind</p><p><strong>Shundar-Quah (Spire Clan)</strong> avalanche, earth elemental, mountain spire or peak, roc, spirestalker</p><p><strong>Sklar-Quah (Sun Clan)</strong> aurochs, cindersnake, emberstorm, fire elemental, flames, the sun</p><p><strong>Skoan-Quah (Skull Clan)</strong> ancestors, earth elemental, giant scarab beetle, vulture, will-o'-wisp, wolf</p><p><strong>Tamiir-Quah (Wind Clan)</strong> air elemental, cloud, griffon, roc, storm, wind</p><p>According to their own tradition, Shoanti have lived in the northwestern lands of Avistan since long before colonizers fractured the Varisians' homeland. Yet the Shoanti people still maintain their independence and traditional way of life in areas across Varisia, particularly on the Storval Plateau.</p><p>Shoanti animism is rooted in a deep connection to the land. Shoanti see the earth not merely as a metaphorical parent, but as a conscious entity whose constant support is necessary for the survival of all life upon it-animal and vegetable alike. Their traditions emphasize connection and the reciprocal way in which the land provides for those who take care of it. The life force of the land serves as the source of Shoanti power and insight, rather than the otherworldly spiritual essence of the Great Beyond common to clerics. This life force is the birth of instinct and faith, and thus it sends omens to indicate future events, warning those with the wisdom to read the signs. Thus most Shoanti hold a profound reverence for natural phenomena as a manifestation of the will of the earth.</p><p><strong>Edicts</strong></p><p><strong>Anathema</strong></span></p><p></span></p><h2>Devotee Benefits</h2>","name":"Shoanti Animism"},{"_id":"3INt1X4ijBYnZYbU","content":"<h1>Shyka (The Many) [N]</h1><p>The Eldest of entropy, reincarnation, and time, Shyka the Many is not a single entity but rather multiple beings who travel forward and backward through time.

Legends state that each face underneath the first six of her seven veils is of a different ancestry-human, elf, halfling, gnome, anadi, and naga- but the seventh face is never shown, believed to mask the goddess's true form. Some theologians believe Sivanah hails from the Shadow Plane, though the goddess's true nature and form continue to be topics of debate.

Those coming to terms with a new gender or sexuality may call on Tlehar's blessing and protection as they learn to better understand themselves. People fleeing from unsafe homes can seek out her followers for safe refuge; these followers of Tlehar wear discrete, iron charms to let others know that they will be ready to fight for them. No matter their needs, Tlehar represents a sanctuary of peace in a sea of fear. It is her hope that the people of Mzali will soon live in fear no longer.</p>\n<p>The dawn goddess is depicted as a human woman with golden skin, the gray-furred head of a lioness, and eyes as black as night. She is often portrayed on Chohar's left side, opposite her sister, with one hand extended in welcome and the other holding an iron morningstar. While Tlehar is not typically as strict in her justice as her counterparts, she shows no mercy to those who hurt the ones they claim to love. She may be willing to forgive those who offer sincere repentance, but the lioness of the dawn has a will of iron. She believes that sometimes, protecting the hope of a better tomorrow means destroying those who cast darkness over the future.</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> give yourself fully to everything you attempt, always maintain hope that tomorrow will be a better day, treasure every gift you are given by those who matter to you.</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> lose your motivation to your regrets, spread despair, treat a loved one poorly</p>\n<p><strong>Follower Alignments</strong> LG, NG, CG</p>\n<h2>Devotee Benefits</h2>\n<div><strong>Divine Font</strong> heal</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Ability</strong> Intelligence or Charisma</div>\n<div><strong>Divine Skill</strong> Crafting</div>\n<div><strong>Favored Weapon</strong> @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.Morningstar]{Morningstar}</div>\n<div><strong>Domains</strong> cities, healing, passion, sun</div>\n<div><strong>Alternate Domains</strong> change, creation, vigil, zeal</div>\n<div><strong>Cleric Spells</strong> 1st: <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Soothe]{Soothe}</em>, 3rd:<em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Enthrall]{Enthrall}</em>, 5th: <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Dreaming Potential]{Dreaming Potential}</em></div>\n<h2>Avatar</h2>\n<p>When casting the <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Avatar]{Avatar}</em> spell, a worshipper of Tlehar gains the following additional abilities.</p>\n<p><strong>Tlehar</strong> Speed 50 feet, Fly speed 70 feet, cannot be @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Immobilized]{Immobilized};</p>\n<p>Melee <span class=\"pf2-icon\">1</span> morningstar (versatile piercing, reach 15 feet), Damage [[/r {6d6+6}[bludgeoning]]]{6d6+6 bludgeoning damage};</p>\n<p>Ranged <span class=\"pf2-icon\">1</span> morning light (range increment 120 feet), Damage [[/r {3d6+3}[fire]]]{3d6+3 fire} and [[/r {3d6+3}[positive]]]{3d6+3 positive damage}</p>","name":"Tlehar"},{"_id":"sZrdzh0ANQnZGXJb","content":"<h1>Torag (The Forge Father) [LG]</span></h1><p><img class=\"thumbnail\" style=\"float: right;\" src=\"https://2e.aonprd.com/Images/Deities/Torag.png\" width=\"119\" height=\"119\">The head of the dwarven pantheon is the most visible of the dwarven deities, to the extent that Torag is the only dwarven deity most non-dwarves know of. While the other dwarven gods represent specific areas of dwarven life and culture, thus forming an expansive and comprehensive dwarven pantheon, Torag's areas of concern are those most central to dwarven society. In his own family, Torag models the values of community and protection that have cemented deep-rooted relationships among dwarven clans. His focus on strategy and tactical acumen centers on protection, reflected in dwarves' impenetrable fortresses and conservative military tactics, including their willingness to use offensive maneuvers as a form of defense. He also represents the forge: the creation of fine works from raw materials, practice and mastery of a craft, and pride in one's work. His purview extends even to those activities that feed the forge and dwarven artisanship, such as mining the earth for raw ore and gemstones. Torag's oversight over these core concepts has secured his place at the head of the dwarven pantheon for ages. It was Torag who sent the dwarves on their legendary Quest for Sky during the Age of Darkness, and his worship was long-established even then. Indeed, among dwarves, Torag is often called the Father of Creation.</p><p><strong>Edicts</strong> be honorable and forthright, keep your word, respect the forge, serve your people</p><p><strong>Anathema</strong> tell lies or cheat someone, intentionally create inferior works, show mercy to the enemies of your people</p><p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> forge, protection, and strategy</p><p><strong>Follower Alignments</strong> LG, LN</span></p><p></span></p><h2>Devotee Benefits</h2><div><div><strong>Divine Ability</strong> Constitution or Wisdom</div><div><strong>Divine Font</strong> heal</div><div><strong>Divine Skill</strong> Crafting</div><div><strong>Favored Weapon</strong> warhammer</div><div><strong>Domains</strong> creation, earth, family, protection</div><div><strong>Alternate Domains</strong> duty</div><div><strong>Cleric Spells</strong> 1st: mindlink, 3rd: earthbind, 4th: creation</div></div><h2>Divine Intercession</h2><p>Torag makes his pleasure or displeasure known through unsubtle signs.</p><p><strong>Minor Boon</strong>: Torag repairs your equipment so you may continue your vigil. Once, a shield, weapon, or other item you hold or are wearing recovers all of its Hit Points. The item's Hardness doubles for 1 minute. Torag can grant this boon just as the item would have been destroyed, preventing the item's destruction. Occasionally, he grants this boon to restore an item important to dwarven history that has already been fully destroyed.</p><p><strong>Moderate Boon</strong>: You are counted as family among Torag and his followers. You gain the effects of a single dwarf ancestry feat of Torag's choice, even if you are not a dwarf, as long as you maintain Torag's blessing.</p><p><strong>Major Boon</strong>: Standing watch or guarding a location counts as resting for you, preventing you from being fatigued due to lack of rest as long as you stand watch for at least 6 hours a day.

When on guard, you gain a +4 status bonus to Perception to notice ambushes and other dangers approaching.

Members of your community have their attitudes towards you shift two steps worse, meaning those who used to be helpful are now indifferent, those who were friendly are now unfriendly, and all others are now hostile.

In the past, Walkena was a mortal descendant of the gods that ruled over Mzali in ancient times, one of the sun kings from an old empire and a golden age of the city. Ages later, his preserved body was found by members of the Council of Mwanyisa, who ruled Mzali at that time. Believing him to be an omen of the city's impending resurgence, the council took him to put him on display in Mzali.
